# OVMS-Plugins
Open Vehicle Monitoring System Plugins

Currently the plugins have been designed and tested mainly on 2013 Nissan Leaf with OVMS V3. But with little or no chnages they should work on other vehicles as well.

## Available Plugins
 - [Heating Assist](heat-assist)
 - [Climate Control Timers](cctimer)
 - [Charging Monitor](chargemon)

Plugins are usually frontend page + backend script, but here you might find some working scripts that are called plugins withut front end. This is becasue I did not havetime to make fronteds for them yet, or they are insignificant to require a fronted.

Anyway, you can find more info on how OVMS plugins work at:
 - https://docs.openvehicles.com/en/latest/userguide/scripting.html
 - https://docs.openvehicles.com/en/latest/plugin/README.html

I will aim to release only working scripts here, but note that they may or may not work on your setup. Meaning that the users of these plugins must use them at their own risk.
